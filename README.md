# Linear Regression Model for Predicting Yearly Amount Spent

## Project Overview
This project builds a linear regression model to predict the `Yearly Amount Spent` by customers based on various numerical features, such as:
- `Avg. Session Length`
- `Time on App`
- `Time on Website`
- `Length of Membership`

The dataset contains customer-related metrics, and the goal is to analyze the relationship between these features and customer spending behavior.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Email**: Customer's email (not used for modeling)
- **Address**: Customer's address (not used for modeling)
- **Avatar**: Customer's avatar color (not used for modeling)
- **Avg. Session Length**: Average time spent in a session
- **Time on App**: Time spent using the app
- **Time on Website**: Time spent on the website
- **Length of Membership**: Duration of customer membership
- **Yearly Amount Spent**: Target variable (amount spent by the customer annually)

## Dependencies
To run this project, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Load the dataset (ensure it is in a CSV format or preloaded into a DataFrame).
2. Select the relevant numerical features and the target variable.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
5. Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared score
6. Visualize the actual vs. predicted values using `seaborn`.

## Model Performance
The trained model provides insights into how different features impact customer spending. The model coefficients help determine the significance of each feature.

## Visualization
A scatter plot is generated to compare actual and predicted values, allowing an assessment of model accuracy.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with feature engineering to improve accuracy.
- Try other regression techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression.
- Explore additional data sources for deeper insights.
